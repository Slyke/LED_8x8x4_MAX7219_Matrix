## Running this code:
Just copy and paste into the Arduino IDE and upload it to your Arduino. Make sure that you have set the pins correctly in the file!

## Custom Message:
Just change everything in between the quotes on line 33. Don't forget to remove doBinaryCount() and scrollFont() in the loop() function! Unless you want them there that is.
